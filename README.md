# Draft Schematic Maker
    This tool is meant to create the details for schematics. It was made to be a light weight simplistic editor.
    Simply input details in each drop down and text field and press generate script at the bottom (green button).

## Notes
    1. When wanting multiple objects as additional templates press the add additional objects button.
        1. The object in the object text field will be the base template object.
    2. You can manually write in any resource and/or object type but it will attempt to autocomplete for you.
    3. Take care to not use any objects that shouldn't be used but are in the autocomplete.

## Known issues / bugs
    1. As of now I am aware of some resources missing from the autocomplete feature.
    2. Objects that shouldn't be used as crafting ingredients or final products are listed with autocomplete.
    3. The layout and coloring is essentially ugly.
